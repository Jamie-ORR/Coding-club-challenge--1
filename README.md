# Coding club challenge #1
A short series of tasks for the first ORR coding club
 
# Reposity contents #2
This project contains one R script and one csv. The R script contains the code to generate the dummy data and the questions for the coding challenge. The dummy data (task1.csv) contains the data to which the questions relate. The script can be found in the script folder, while the data can be found in the data folder.

The data contains three columns. These three columns contain data on the name (ordered Surname, First name),  number of ice creams eaten anually and a favorite seabird for each row. There are no NA values. This is simulated data, but for the sake of immersion:<br>
This data was gathered by surveying 2,500,000 people across the world on thier ice cream consumption and favorite UK seabird. The person who collected this data needs to answer a series of questions before the next coding club session, as the Minister for Birds and Icecream is on a tight deadline.

# Question guidence #3
Each question must be answered with a sentence. You can use as much code as you want to process the data, but the end result must be a sentence which answers the question. See the example question and solution in the R script for an example on on what this means.

You can use any coding language you want, but you will need to be able to talk through your soloutions and explain what each line of code is doing in genreal terms, when presenting you solutions.

# Question list #4
Each of the questions can be found in the R script, but they are also listed below, so you can copy them over to another workbook/Intergrated Development Environment (IDE), if you need.



#1#How many people ate less than 50 ice creams?



#2#How many people chose a puffin as their favorite seabird?



#3#How many people chose a Kittiwake as their favorite seabird and ate over 7000 ice creams?



#4#How many people had first names starting with P?



#5#How many people had second names starting with A?



#6#How many people had double barreled surnames (contains a -)?



#7#What was the name of the person who ate the most ice creams of those who liked the Sandwich tern?



#8#Ordered alphabetically, by first surname, who comes 89,576th
